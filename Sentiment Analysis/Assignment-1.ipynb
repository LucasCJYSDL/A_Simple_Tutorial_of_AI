Background\n","In this assignment, we are trying to do simple sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis is the process of detecting positive or negative sentiment in text. It’s often used by businesses to detect sentiment in social data, gauge brand reputation, and understand customers.\n","\n","The dataset we will be using is called the [***Stanford Sentiment Treebank***](https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/code.html). This dataset is collected from movie reviews on *Rotten Tomatoes* and includes over 20k sentences. All reviews were later re-organized as distinct phrases with a label as a number between 0.0 and 1.0. Labels can later be divided in to five intervals [0, 0.2], (0.2, 0.4], (0.4, 0.6], (0.6, 0.8], (0.8, 1.0] which means very negative, negative, neutral, positive, and very positive, respectively.\n","\n","The dataset we are using in this assignment is a subset of Stanford Sentiment Treebank and consists of only **400 phrases**. For simplicity, the dataset only contains extreme sentiments; half of them are extremely positive reviews (have corresponding range (0.9, 1.0]), and the other half are extremely negative reviews (have corresponding range [0.0, 0.1]).\n","\n","In machine learning (ML), the process of optimizing the model given some dataset is known as *training* or *learning*---thus the data used during training is merely called the *training data* (e.g., historicial reviews). This is analagous to a student seeing worked-out problems in class to help understand a concept.  However, after the model has been trained, it will be used to predict on new data (e.g., new reviews)---this is what is often called *test data*. This process is analagous to a student taking a test and requires them to understand the concepts rather than just memorizing the problems worked-out in class. We will cover these concepts in more detail later on in the lectures.\n","\n","To *simulate* this process and evaluate your model *as if it was deployed*, we will split the dataset into two parts: a training dataset (50%) and test dataset (50%), where both have an equal number of positive and negative reviews.\n","\n","Your job is to manually construct a simple function that determines whether a single phrase (input) has a positive or negative sentiment (output/return value). You are only allowed to see and optimize using the **training dataset** (simulating model training in ML), but we provide a function that performs a final evaluation of your model on the **testing dataset** (simulating the model being deployed in the real world). \n","\n","*Note: We obfuscate (i.e., make secret) the testing function because in the real world, you won't know what the new data will look like.*"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"IuRq9xvxNoX4"},"source":["## 2.

The test dataset stored in 'test.npy' is used in the next evaluation section but you should not look at this (see discussion above).
