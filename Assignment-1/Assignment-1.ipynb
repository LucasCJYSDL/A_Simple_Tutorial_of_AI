Background\n","In this assignment, we are trying to do simple sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis is the process of detecting positive or negative sentiment in text. Itâ€™s often used by businesses to detect sentiment in social data, gauge brand reputation, and understand customers.\n","\n","The dataset we will be using is called the [***Stanford Sentiment Treebank***](https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/code.html). This dataset is collected from movie reviews on *Rotten Tomatoes* and includes over 20k sentences. All reviews were later re-organized as distinct phrases with a label as a number between 0.0 and 1.0. Labels can later be divided in to five intervals [0, 0.2], (0.2, 0.4], (0.4, 0.6], (0.6, 0.8], (0.8, 1.0] which means very negative, negative, neutral, positive, and very positive, respectively.\n","\n","The dataset we are using in this assignment is a subset of Stanford Sentiment Treebank and consists of only **400 phrases**. For simplicity, the dataset only contains extreme sentiments; half of them are extremely positive reviews (have corresponding range (0.9, 1.0]), and the other half are extremely negative reviews (have corresponding range [0.0, 0.1]).\n","\n","In machine learning (ML), the process of optimizing the model given some dataset is known as *training* or *learning*---thus the data used during training is merely called the *training data* (e.g., historicial reviews). This is analagous to a student seeing worked-out problems in class to help understand a concept.  However, after the model has been trained, it will be used to predict on new data (e.g., new reviews)---this is what is often called *test data*. This process is analagous to a student taking a test and requires them to understand the concepts rather than just memorizing the problems worked-out in class. We will cover these concepts in more detail later on in the lectures.\n","\n","To *simulate* this process and evaluate your model *as if it was deployed*, we will split the dataset into two parts: a training dataset (50%) and test dataset (50%), where both have an equal number of positive and negative reviews.\n","\n","Your job is to manually construct a simple function that determines whether a single phrase (input) has a positive or negative sentiment (output/return value). You are only allowed to see and optimize using the **training dataset** (simulating model training in ML), but we provide a function that performs a final evaluation of your model on the **testing dataset** (simulating the model being deployed in the real world). \n","\n","*Note: We obfuscate (i.e., make secret) the testing function because in the real world, you won't know what the new data will look like.*"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"IuRq9xvxNoX4"},"source":["## 2.

The test dataset stored in 'test.npy' is used in the next evaluation section but you should not look at this (see discussion above).
